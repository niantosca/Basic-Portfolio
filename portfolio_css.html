    <div class= "block"><p id="p1"> <img id="face" src="/Users/nickiantosca/Desktop/Dumb.jpg" alt="dumb_face">I was born and raised in the Richmond, Virginia area. I have two siblings, one brother, and one sister, both older than me. 
        I attended Trinity Episcopal High School here in Richmond. Following this, I attended a small private university in Rhode Island
         for a year, Roger Williams University. I then studied abroad in Seville, Spain for almost a year, through a program with the
          University of New Haven. Returning back to Virginia, I finished my degree at Virginia Commonwealth University. Not satisfied 
          with the opportunities that my degree afforded me, and after bouncing around between a few jobs, I discovered an interest in 
          coding. This led me to the decision of gaining a more formal education in the subject. I am currently enrolled in the 
          University of Richmondâ€™s Coding Bootcamp. Although challenging at times, I am learning a lot from the program, 
          and look forward to launching a new career in the field of computer programming.
